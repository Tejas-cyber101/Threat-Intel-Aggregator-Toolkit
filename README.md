# Threat Intelligence Aggregator (Non-AI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This toolkit is designed to automate the collection and correlation of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). It fetches live data from open-source intelligence (OSINT) providers, standardizes the formats, and identifies high-risk threats seen across multiple sources.

## 🚀 Key Features (Based on Project Documentation)
- **Multi-Source Ingestion:** Fetches live feeds from Emerging Threats, Binary Defense, and Abuse.ch.
- **Data Normalization:** Automatically parses and validates IPs, Domains, and MD5 Hashes using Regex.
- **Correlation Engine:** Identifies high-priority threats by finding matches across different feeds.
- **Automated Deliverables:** Generates firewall-ready blocklists and comprehensive JSON threat reports.
- **Visual Analytics:** Produces a dashboard showing the distribution of identified threats.
